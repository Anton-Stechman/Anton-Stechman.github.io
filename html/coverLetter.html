                Hello,<br/>
                My Name is Anton. I am 30 Years old,<br> I have three children.
                I am a hobbyist Game Developer, in the 'Games' Section of this Website<br/> 
                you will find some of my creations.<br/> 
            </p>
            <p>
                I first took up Game Deveopment 6 years ago<br/>
                after a bit of researching I found the Unity3D Game Engine.
                I found I quite enjoyed playing around with it and building scenes.
                 Eventually I started to get into the programming side of Game&#45;dev &amp; loved it.<br/>
                Since then I have been practicing, learning and developing my skills
                in hopes that I could one day become a Software Engineer<br/>  
            </p>
            <p>
                Early last year &#40;2019&#41; I decided to resign from my position
                 as Butchery Manager at Raeward Fresh Harewood to pursue my dream career.<br/>
                Since then I have undertaken a Diploma in Web Development through The Open Polytech<br/>
                I have been really enjoying studying knowing that I am working towards my future!<br/>
                since I have been studying I have achieved some great results 
                 and have almosted completed my Diploma!<br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                Starting March 2020 I will be starting a Bachelors Degree in IT
                I am hoping to have this completed by mid 2021.
